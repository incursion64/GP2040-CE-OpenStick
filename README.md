# GP2040-CE OpenStick by Game Room Customs
 Custom Arcade Fight Stick

 The goal here was to design something heavyweight and durable but also offer something that was modular and easy to build and looks nice. 
 Steel Construction - 14GA CRS - Powder Coated
 3D Printed PETG Corners with threaded M4 Inserts
 3D Printed Custom Stick Spacer (to control height of the stick petruding from the case toper) This height is really based on preference. 
 Custom printed & machine cut graphics

Included in this repository are all necessary files to process the material.
 - 2D DXF Files for laser cut metal & plastic cover
 - STL files for 3D printed Corners and spacer
 - PDF dimensionalized Prints
 - Bill of Materials for what i used

Graphic Template has not been included as you need only import the 2D DXF to Adobe illustrator or preferred program to process your artwork. 
If you decide to go with a snap in type button, be mindful that you can work with the approx 4mmm thickness. I was able to get Sanwa genuine and clones in there. For the
clone types i had to make sure clips/anchors pushed out all the way so the button is secure. The plastic is 2mm thick in my desing, you may want to consider 1mm.  If using the screw on top
arcade buttons you can go heavier.  
Also note that i use a stick spacer.  This is not necessary if you want your stick to sit higher, but i added a 6mm (1/4") thick spacer to set the height where i like it. You could always add stick extensions as well.
